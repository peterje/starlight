          <p>
            Payment in full is required upon receipt of digital invoice to secure your event date and time. Your invoice can be paid online with a valid credit or debit card, we do not accept cash, check or money order. Until payment is received, your event date and details of your request (date, time, duration, character) are not secured and can be booked by another client. Details of the event cannot be changed after securing event without forfeiture of payment unless mutually agreed upon by the host and The Starlight Studio. If applicable, the host must provide and pay any parking fees for the performers to attend any event. Gratuity to the performer is always appreciated, and can be paid on your invoice at the time of booking or in cash to your performer on the day of the event. We ask that you do not discuss or give gratuity directly in front of children. If cancellation by The Starlight Studio occurs, a full refund of your payment will be issued to the card used to reserve your event.

          <h2 class="text-h3 text-lg-h3 my-2 primary--text">Requirements</h2>
          <p>Hosts must provide a safe and clean environment for our performers, be courteous and respectful and interact appropriately with The Starlight Studio personnel. Inappropriate behavior or language directed at Starlight Studio personnel will end the event. Please save all questions not related to the character performance for before or after the appearance to maintain character integrity. Host must be present at all times during the appearance. Parents/Guardians are responsible for any disruptions to the performance due to children’s behavior. Due to the nature of the expensive handmade gowns we ask that events take place indoors unless previously discussed and agreed upon between Starlight Studio and the Host. In the case of outdoor events, characters will need a dry area free of mud and dirt. We are unable to accommodate an outdoor event if the temperature is 90 degrees or above. In order to prevent costume and wig damage, we cannot do outdoor events in rain/inclement weather. In the event of extreme heat or rain, an alternate location must be provided by the Host in order to avoid damage to costumes and wigs. Food, drink and cigarette smoke is not permitted near the performer for the same reason. If you are having a pool or water party, please plan for children to be in dry clothing during interaction with the performer, and have separate space away from the pool or body of water where the activities can take place.</p>
